```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

1. Create a `Header2` header below with the name "Answer 1".

## Answer 1

2. Add an unordered list (in Markdown syntax) of your favorite food dishes and
add their ingredients as sub-items in the list. You should enter at least two
dishes with two ingredients each.

- Cheesy Lentils and Rice
  - half cup brown lentils
  - quarter cup white rice
  - 2 tbsp powdered cheese
  
- Baked Tofu
  - 1 package extra firm tofu, cubed
  - 2 tbsp liquid aminos
  - 1 tbsp nutritional yeast

3. Add an R code chunk below. Show the `summary` of the `Orange` dataset. Run a
linear regression using the `lm` function to predict `circumference` from `age`
and assign the result. Show the `summary` of the fit object that you assigned. 

```{r}
data(Orange)
Orangesummary <- summary(Orange)
print(Orangesummary)
lmorange <- lm(circumference ~ age, data = Orange)
summary(lmorange)
```


4. Add a link below (_in RMarkdown format_) to your favorite R reference website.

5. Replace the author field in the `yaml` header with your name and `knit` the
RMarkdown document into a Word document (make sure that the document 'knits').
First clone the `CUNYSPHcode/IntroR_FinalAssignment` onto your GitHub account.
Then, create a pull request on GitHub with the **modified** RMarkdown file.
